    "<h1>The Monty Hall Problem</h1>\n",
    "<p><b>Explanation -></b> Imagine that you’re on a television game show and the host presents you with three closed doors. Behind one of them, sits a sparkling, brand-new Lincoln Continental; behind the other two, are smelly old goats. The host implores you to pick a door, and you select door #1. Then, the host, who is well-aware of what’s going on behind the scenes, opens door #3, revealing one of the goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now,” he says, turning toward you, “do you want to keep door #1, or do you want to switch to door #2?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Loosely based on the famous television game show Let’s Make a Deal, the scenario presented above, better known as the “Monty Hall Problem,” is a rather famous probability question. Despite its deceptive simplicity, some of the world’s brightest minds -- MIT professors, renowned mathematicians, and MacArthur “Genius” Fellows -- have had trouble grasping its answer. For decades, it has sparked intense debates in classrooms and lecture halls.</p>\n",

    "    <li>The door to open</li>\n",
    "    <li>The door to change or switch to if offered</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "Hint:  Randomly choose each, then make sure the door to open is not the prize or stay.  Then make sure the door to switch to if offered is not the stay or door to open."
